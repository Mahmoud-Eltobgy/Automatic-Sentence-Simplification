# Automatic Sentence Simplification

This project targets on the lexical simplification of a sentence based on the Context Aware Approach presented by Or Biran and Samuel Brody. Currently, I am working on detecting the complexity of a sentence based on the count based approach. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
python 3.6
nltk
ast
simple-wiki corpus
english-wiki corpus
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Install python 3.6 and ADD that to your PYTHONPATH
```

Install pip

```
Install the package manager for python by going at this link [Download pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
```

Install nltk

```
pip install nltk
